Hello there, this is Ruiyuan. Feel free to call me any name you like. I've been using different nicknames on the internet, like *Ruiyuan "Mizumoto" Xu*, Or *Buta* .

I am not the kind of person, who can give out a straightforward answer, when asked the question, "how will you describe yourself". A Golang developer maybe.

But frankly speaking, I'm a rather new developer to the Golang world. Before that, I've been using C++ for the most of my time, back in my University, Renmin University of China. I was also a C# fan at that time.

I love *"the United Union of C Plus Plus"* for its **mightiness** as well as I love *C#* for its **elegance**.

Then I decided to go on some adventures. I spent half a year at the Library of Hubei, and just before I was able to go to Tokyo the covid-19 bursted. I was stuck in the countryside for four months, and finally made my way to Japan in Dec. 2020.

I sincerely appreciate my professor and all the teachers in the lab, for selflessly educating us about bioinformatics, during my 2-year research student career.

But I would say that I didn't really have much time coding in lab during that time, the phrase "junior bioinformatics" means that you just need to run different datasets. Just take a dataset provided by essay A over, and throw it into another algorithms wriiten in essay B. Sort of "import-package-oriented-programming" I'd rather say. As a matter of fact, our lab doesn't do any sort of experiments, so you'll have to repeat this all the time. I understand that some smarter guy can always find something out of nothing, but I started to doubt whether I'm smart enough to be smarter than the ones who do experiments. Or am I sharp enough to develop "better" algorithms and manage to find a just-fit dataset.  

The 11-month stay at home in Wuhan kind of hurt my state of mind in 2020. But I daren't to go outside in Japan as well. There was no vaccine until Aug. 2021 in Japan and I stayed at home for another 8months, which was extremely torturous. I had only a few people to tlak with and was finally beaten down by the pressure and got ulcerative colitis. It took me almost another whole year to get myself back to healthy, mental and physical.

I felt lost during those days, friends told me I was more like a medical student that time. I eventually decided to take a break from my research career, to rediscover the joys of coding.

### Dub Dub

Now I am on a journey to become a powerful Go developer. I am impressed by not only the elegance and cleanliness of go but its powerful performance as well.

Hopefully I'll try to get a job as a backend engineer.

Wish me good luck.
