Hello there, this is Ruiyuan. Feel free to call me any name you like. I've been using different nicknames on the internet, like *Ruiyuan "Mizumoto" Xu*, Or *Buta* .

I am not the kind of person, who can give out a straightforward answer, when asked the question, "how will you describe yourself". A Golang developer maybe.

But frankly speaking, I'm a rather new developer to the Golang world. Before that, I've been using C++ for the most of my time, back in my University, Renmin University of China. I was also a C# fan at that time.

I love *"the United Union of C Plus Plus"* for its **mightiness** as well as I love *C#* for its **elegance**.
