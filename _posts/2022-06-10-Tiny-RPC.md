## So, it's time for some light-weight demo code.

## What is TRPcG ✈

TRPcG is short for "Tiny Remote Procedure-call in Go", a fast, stable, light-weight and high-performance RPC framework for Go.

It's also a example `net/rpc`-based RPC framework which can help people better understand RPC.

- TCP based
- Support for multiple compression formats : gzip, snappy, zlib, etc.
- Implemented protocol buffer. May be cross-platform in future.
- protoc-gen-trpcg plug-in allows you define your own service.
- Support for custom serialization. See [Customize](#Customize)

## Install & Quick Start

- install `protoc` at <https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases>
- install `protoc-gen-go` and `proto-gen`

```bash
go install github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
go install github.com/mizumoto-cn/TRPcG/proto-gen
```

Then you'll need to create a `arith.proto` file to define the rpc services.

Use `protoc` to generate code:

```bash
protoc --trpcg_out=. arith.proto --go_out=. arith.proto
```

Two files will be generated in the directory `message`: `arith.pb.go` and `arith.svr.go`

Then you need a new `main.go` like [main.go.bak](main.go.bak)

After that you can implement your rpc client.

```golang
...
conn, err := net.Dial("tcp", ":8082")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer conn.Close()
client := TRPcG.NewClient(conn)
req := &message.ArithRequest{ A: 1, B: 2 }
res := &message.ArithResponse{}
err = client.Call("Arith.Add", &req, &res)
log.Printf("%d + %d = %d, %v", req.A, req.B, res.C, err)
...
```

You may also use `AsyncCall` to get a asynchronous return in the form of `*rpc.Call`

```golang

result := client.AsyncCall("ArithService.Add", &resq, &resp)
select {
case call := <-result:
	log.Printf("Arith.Add(%v, %v): %v ,Error: %v", resq.A, resq.B, resp.C, call.Error)
case <-time.After(100 * time.Microsecond):
	log.Fatal("time out")
}
```

## Customize

### Compressor

You can choose to use 'gzip', 'snappy', 'zlib', or 'raw' to compress the data.

Like:

```golang
import "github.com/mizumoto-cn/TRPcG/compressor"

...
client := tinyrpc.NewClient(conn, tinyrpc.WithCompress(compressor.Gzip))
```

### Serializer

You'll need to implement `Serializer` interface to use customized serialization.

```golang
type Serializer interface {
    Serialize(interface{}) ([]byte, error)
    Deserialize([]byte, interface{}) error
}
```

Here is a simple implementation of `Serializer` in `json` format:

```golang

type JsonSerializer struct {}

func (s *JsonSerializer) Serialize(v interface{}) ([]byte, error) {
    return json.Marshal(v)
}

func (s *JsonSerializer) Deserialize(b []byte, v interface{}) error {
    return json.Unmarshal(b, v)
}
```

And we can use it to define a `service` like:

```golang
type JsonRequest struct {
	Req string `json:"req"`
}

type JsonResponce struct {
	Res string `json:"res"`
}

type RepeatService struct{}

func (_ *JsonService) Repeater(args *JsonRequest, reply *JsonResponse) error {
	reply.Res = args.Req
	return nil
}
```

Also, we'll have to assign `json` serializer to `server`:

```golang
listener, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":8082")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
server := TRPcG.NewServer(listener, TRPcG.WithSerializer(&JsonSerializer{}))
server.Register(&JsonService{})
server.Serve(listener)
```

Remember your client also need to assign `json` serializer when you create it:

```golang
client := TRPcG.NewClient(conn, TRPcG.WithSerializer(&JsonSerializer{}))
```

## Architecture

TRPcG Client will send request messages, and which will be three parts: an unsigned-int Header Info, a Header, and a Body based on [Protocol Buffers (Google Developers)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/gotutorial)

Here is a picture of the Request Stream:

![Request Stream](https://github.com/mizumoto-cn/TRPcG/blob/master/arc/Request.svg)

![Response Stream](https://github.com/mizumoto-cn/TRPcG/blob/master/arc/Response.svg)

> `uvarint` is just like a variable-length unsigned-integer. It's an encoding of 64-bit unsigned integers into between 1 and 9 bytes.

The `Header` is based on a customized protocol.

`ID` is like a serial code of the rpc calls, with which in concurrent cases, clients can determine whether it's a successful call based on the ID serial number of the response.
