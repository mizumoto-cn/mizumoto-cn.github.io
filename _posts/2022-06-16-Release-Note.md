Here I'm glad to announce the release of [TRPcG](https://github.com/mizumoto-cn/TRPcG) and [GoBalancer](https://github.com/mizumoto-cn/GoBalancer).

TRPcG âœˆ is a fast, stable, light-weight and high-performance RPC framework for Go. It's also a example `net/rpc`-based RPC framework which can help people better understand RPC.

Go Balancer ðŸš¦ is a fast, stable, light-weight layer-7 load balancer written in go. Based on `net/http/httputil`, also a load-balancing algorithm library.

Both of them are released under the [Mizumoto General Public License v1.2](https://https://github.com/mizumoto-cn/Mizumoto.Licence/blob/main/Mizumoto%20General%20Public%20License%20v1.2.md) as usual. Which is basically a Mozilla Public License v2.0, but with special restrictions:
