Given a set of code like this, what is the output?

```golang
package main

func main() {
    ary = [...]int{
        'a': 1,
        'b': 2,
        'c': 3,
    }
    ary['a'] = 100
    println(len(ary))
}
```

To make things easier, I'll just give you four choices.

A. 3
B. 2
C. 100
D. Compilation error

And surprise! The answer is C.

This question is all about the `rune` type and `array` declaration in go.

In golang documentation, you can find the `rune` type [here](https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#rune).
Which says that `rune` is an alias for `int32`, and

> A rune literal represents a rune constant, an integer value that represents a Unicode code point.
> A rune literal is expressed as one or more characters enclosed in single quotes, as in 'x' or '\n'.

When we give the compiler a simple 'a', it will treat the 'a' as a unsigned `rune` constant.
And unsigned instants serving as the index of an array, will be given type `int`.

Here is a simple example:

```golang
const r = 'a' // ok
var a int = r // ok

const r rune = 'a' // ok
var a int = r // cannot use r as type int in assignment
```

We know that `'a'` in ascii is 97, and `rune` is an alias for `int32`, so the compiler will treat `'a'` as a `int32` constant, with value 97.
So the code at the beginning will be same as:

```golang
package main

func main() {
    ary = [...]int{
        97: 1,
        98: 2,
        99: 3,
    }
    ary[97] = 100
    println(len(ary))
}
```

Obviously, the answer is C.100.
